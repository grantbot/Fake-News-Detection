# Final-Project
This project is intended to train a Naive Bayes machine learning model to detect whether or not a news article from a predetermined dataset is a trustworthy article or not.  

There are two datasets of news articles supplied in this repo, Fake.csv and True.csv, which you will need to import into the DataFinalProjectNaiveBayes.ipynb file.  

Open DataFinalProjectNaiveBayes.ipynb with Google Colab, run the pyspark install and library imports and then upload Fake.csv and True.csv.  

Fake.csv should be uploaded to to the "uploaded" variable, True.csv belongs to the "uploaded2" variable.
